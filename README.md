# ðŸ§  DSA Playground

Welcome to my Problem Solving & DSA notebook.  
Just a dev grinding through patterns, logic, and edge casesâ€”starting with Java, moving to JS later.  
Not too formal, just real talk + useful notes.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s this repo?

This is where I document:
- DSA questions Iâ€™ve solved
- The thought process behind them
- Logic breakdowns
- My notes, mistakes, and learnings
- Occasional rants when LeetCode humbles me
